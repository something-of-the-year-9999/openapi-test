  summary: Diagnostic Endpoint
  description: |-
      This endpoint allows for diagnostic requests to trace the route of a request from the client to the server.  
      It can be used to verify network paths and intermediary proxies but should be restricted to authorized users for security reasons.

    summary: Diagnostic Request
    description: |-
        This request is used to send back the received request to the client, allowing the user to trace the path of the request.  
        This can be useful for debugging purposes, such as detecting network issues or validating proxies.  
        However, it should be used cautiously as the request headers and body will be mirrored in the response, potentially exposing sensitive data.
